It was a birthday of one of my friend and I wanted to wish her in a special way. So this animated web page is done for me to say Happy Birthday in real quick.

Feel free to use it to wish your friend if you want.
You can get it running in a few easy steps:

* Fork the repository
* Open `customize.json` and replace name/wish-message/image with your own. Alternatively, you can go directly into `index.html` for further customization according to your mother language (Note that in this case the values in your `customize.json` should be empty string so that it will not overwrite the content in `index.html`)
* Turn on GitHub pages for the repository (Settings > GitHub Pages)
* Send the URL that you get at the above step to your friend :)
